## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an e-commerce application using a microservices architecture, which can be deployed on the cloud using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Git. The application will consist of several microservices that communicate with each other to provide various functionalities like user management, product management and order management.

### Technologies Used

- **Microservices**: Design and implemented the microservices architecture using Node.js.
- **Docker**: Created Docker containers for each microservice.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrated the Docker containers using Kubernetes.
- **Jenkins**: Implemented a Jenkins pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Git**: Used Git for version control and integrated it with Jenkins for automated builds and deployments.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the backend database.
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ is used for message queuing to handle asynchronous communication between microservices.
